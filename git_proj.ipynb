Genomic risk prediction is effective for diseases that are underpinned by a few major genes. However, most complex diseases are the result of polygenic traits that involve thousands of small variants, for which current approaches to genomic risk prediction are not useful in clinical practice.In this research degree project you will focus on developing novel approaches to increase the accuracy of genomic risk prediction through novel methods including machine learning-based methods.This is an exceptional research project that may revolutionise human health through disease prediction.What you’ll doIn this research degree project, you will explore advanced approaches to disease prediction through genomic analysis assisted by statistical modelling, artificial intelligence and machine learning.You will undertake computer programming in the context of statistical genetics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and have access to various genotypic, phenotypic and other environmental variables that are key resources in developing the novel genomic prediction methods.As a part of a world-class research centre, you will develop a strong track record of research achievement and develop publications and novel software.This research degree project offers exclusive opportunities to present your work and network with industry, including travel to GeneMappers, a national conference in human quantitative genetics. In your third year, you will have the opportunity to attend the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) Annual Meeting which is one of the biggest human genetic conferences in the world.This is an exceptional research degree that will prepare you to be an expert in genomic research through `big data’.Where you’ll be basedYou’ll be based in the Australian Centre for Precision Health which brings together a multidisciplinary group of leading experts in genomics, population health and evidence translation to create the next generation of solutions for global health problems.Our mission is to prevent disease before it strikes, and to create innovative solutions to address issues focused on health and wellbeing.

AI\\xa0faces a crisis of legitimacy. This project aims to use technically- and empirically-grounded political philosophy to make Australia a global leader in the study and design of\\xa0democratically legitimate AI, and to foster and lead a growing field: the political philosophy of data and AI. We aim to recruit a talented political philosopher with substantial interest in the\\xa0social and political impacts of AI and related technologies, and the willingness to engage with technical and empirical research on AI and its impacts in order to make first-order\\xa0progress in political philosophy, with a view to publication with leading philosophy journals and presses, as well as to interdisciplinary engagement.\\xa0The successful applicant will work alongside Professor Seth Lazar, as well as broader team of philosophy postdocs, PhD students, honours students, and research assistants as part of the\\xa0Machine Intelligence and Normative Theory lab (MINT, launching January 2022). They will also be part of the broader interdisciplinary HMI network. HMI is a cross-university\\xa0research project uniting philosophy, computer science, law, political science and sociology in the study and design of democratically legitimate AI. MINT will provide the Research\\xa0Fellow with a focused (normative) philosophical research community and mentorship, while HMI will enable them to work closely with scholars from other fields, and other areas of\\xa0philosophy, exploring the societal impacts of AI. The Research Fellow will also be an active member of the School of Philosophy (SoP)\\xa0with access to a thriving intellectual community exploring a wide range of philosophical issues.\\xa0We are looking for a Research Fellow to join these communities for up to four years (shorter durations may be considered), and to advance the 'Automatic Authorities' project under the\\xa0guidance of Professor Lazar. Our primary criteria are (a) clear potential to write influential philosophy papers, which make first-order progress in moral and/or political philosophy, and\\xa0(b) willingness to seriously invest in understanding the societal impacts of new technologies involving data and AI, including willingness to develop a basic technical understanding of\\xa0these technologies, and to engage with empirical research on their societal impacts. Note that we do not require prior experience of working on this topic, though it is advantageous. The\\xa0Research Fellow will be actively supported and mentored in building up the technical and empirical competence necessary to advance the project's aims, if they do not already possess\\xa0it.\\xa0The Research Fellow's primary role will be to contribute to the MINT, HMI and School of Philosophy research communities both through their own research, and through engaging\\xa0collaboratively with the work of others. They will publish papers in leading philosophy journals. They will contribute to the organisation of research-related events. They will contribute\\xa0to the delivery of one undergraduate course a year, on Philosophy, AI and Society, as part of a team of 2-4 people. They will travel internationally to present their work at leading\\xa0departments around the world, contributing to the growth of the field of the moral and political philosophy of data and AI.\\xa0Enquiries: Professor Seth Lazar T: +61 42032954 E:\\xa0seth.lazar@anu.edu.au\\nPosition Description:\\xa0\\xa0Research Fellow_Level B_FF21.pdf\\nClosing Date: 11 January 2022\\nANU\\xa0\\nANU is regarded as one of the world's leading research universities.
